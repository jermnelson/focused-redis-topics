   <h3>Fast Overview of Linked Data</h3>
   <p class="lead">
     Based upon <a href="#">Sir Tim Berners-Lee</a> idea of the Semantic
     Web, libraries are adopting various RDF graph-based vocabularies to 
     describe their collections while linking with other institutions and 
     projects to extend and enrich the discovery of their materials by 
     patrons.
   </p>
   <h4>RDF Graphs</h4>
   <p class="lead">
     RDF Graphs are made up of triples, statement made up one each of <em class="label label-primary">Subjects</em>, 
     <em class="label label-warning">Predicates</em>, and <em class="label label-success">Objects</em>.
   </p>
   <p class="lead"><span class="label label-primary">Subjects</span> are made up either IRIs (most commonly an URL),
    or Blank Nodes, unique identifiers within a single RDF graph.
   </p>
   <p class="lead"><span class="label label-warning">Predicates</span> must be IRIs and is the graph edge that connects
   the subject and object entities with a relationship.
   </p>
   <p class="lead"><span class="label label-success">Objects</span> are made up of either URLs, Literal values,
    or Blank Nodes.
